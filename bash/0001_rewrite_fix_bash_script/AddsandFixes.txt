Instead of "Ensure mounting of uncommon filesystems is disabled"

I want them to be listed out indiviudually

1.1.1.1 Ensure mounting of cramfs filesystems is disabled
1.1.1.2 Ensure mounting of freevxfs filesystems is disabled

This needs to be added:
1.1.8 Ensure nodev option set on /var/tmp partition

1.1.10 Ensure noexec option set on /var/tmp partition
1.1.14 Ensure nodev option set on /home partition

1.2.2 Ensure gpgcheck is globally activated
    Fix: Edit /etc/yum.conf and set ' gpgcheck=1 ' in the [main] section.
    Edit any failing files in /etc/yum.repos.d/* and set all instances of gpgcheck to '     1 '.



    dconf update


1.4.1 Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured
    Fix: Run the following commands to set permissions on your grub configuration:
    # chown root:root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    # chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

RHEL6:
1.4.3 Ensure authentication required for single user mode
    Edit /etc/sysconfig/init and set SINGLE to ' /sbin/sulogin ':
    SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin

RHEL7:
1.4.3 Ensure authentication required for single user mode
    Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service and     /usr/lib/systemd/system/emergency.service and set ExecStart to use ' /sbin/sulogin  ':
    ExecStart=-/bin/sh -c "/sbin/sulogin; /usr/bin/systemctl --fail --no-block default"

1.7.2 Ensure GDM login banner is configured (this is missing from script)
    The fix: Create the /etc/dconf/profile/gdm file with the following contents:
    user-db:user
    system-db:gdm
    file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults
    
    Create or edit the banner-message-enable and banner-message-text options in     /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-message :
    [org/gnome/login-screen]
    banner-message-enable=true
    banner-message-text='Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and        reported.'

2.2.1.2 Ensure ntp is configured
    Fix: Add or edit restrict lines in /etc/ntp.conf to match the following:
    restrict -4 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery
    restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

    Add or edit server lines to /etc/ntp.conf as appropriate:
    server <remote-server>

    Add or edit the OPTIONS in /etc/sysconfig/ntpd to include ' -u ntp:ntp ':   
    OPTIONS="-u ntp:ntp"

2.2.2 Ensure X Window System is not installed
    Fix: yum remove xorg-x11*
    
5.2.2 Ensure SSH Protocol is set to 2

    Protocol 2

    Fix: Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set one or more of the parameter as  follows:

    AllowUsers <userlist>
    AllowGroups <grouplist>
    DenyUsers <userlist>
    DenyGroups <grouplist>

6.1.8 Ensure permissions on /etc/group- are configured
    Fix: Run the following command to set permissions on /etc/group- :
